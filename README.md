# Mystery number

This little C program is also known as **More or Less**.  The aim is to find a "mystery" number between 1 and 100 with a minimum number of moves.

The other (and real) aim of this project is to discover the **Travis CI** "cross-compilation" functionalities on GitHub.

# Building targets

Up to day compilation works on :
- Linux (Debian 9) by using of the **make** command in **bash**,  
- Windows (Windows NT) by configuring a **tasks.json** file in **VS Code**.

On one hand the binary target (see the Makefile) is called "Mystery" and the other hand it is called "Mystery.exe".
